# the-dungeon
The AI must crawl the dungeon in order to collect gold. This is just me experimenting while learning AI and machine learning.

Dependencies:
* Python 3
* NumPy

To try it, just run:
```
python3 the_dungeon.py
```

Implemented concepts:
* The basic framework
* Pathfinding using A* search
* Opening doors and picking up gold in the optimal order, using uniform-cost search
